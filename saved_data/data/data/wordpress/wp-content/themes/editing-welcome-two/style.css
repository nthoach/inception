Description: Editing Welcome Two is an elegant and versatile block theme, designed to let you build beautiful and accessible websites easily. It comes with a set of useful patterns, two style variations and a large color palette. The colors from the palette follow a certain naming scheme: A "base" color and a "contrast" color always have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 whereas "decorative" colors do not meet that standard. As a block theme, Editing Welcome Two is fully compatible with the Site Editor and thus very easy to customize.
